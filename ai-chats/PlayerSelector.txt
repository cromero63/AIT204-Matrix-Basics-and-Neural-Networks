User:
I want to create a dropdown or something that will let the user select 5 nba players to represent an optimal team. 
The players should be shown by name (season) and then on the back side give me the ID. 

AI:
Now I'll replace the broken player_selector with a proper multiselect widget that displays players by name and season, and retrieves their IDs:

Perfect! I've updated your app.py with a player selector that:

Multiselect widget - Allows users to select up to 5 NBA players
Display format - Shows player names with their season (e.g., "Joel Embiid (2022-23)")
ID mapping - Automatically retrieves and displays the player IDs of selected players in the sidebar
The selected player IDs will be available in the selected_ids variable, which you can use for your model training. The display shows a helpful info box with the selected IDs once players are chosen.
